# Installation

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
‚ò¢Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
To set up this project on your local machine, follow the steps below.

## 1. **Node.js and npm**

   Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed globally. You can download them from [Node.js's official website](https://nodejs.org/).

Install project-specific dependencies using npm:
```
npm install axios@1.5.0
